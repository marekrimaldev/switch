# Switch 2021

Switch was originally prototyped during Trijam Game Jam in around 3-4 hours. The theme for the game jam was optical illusion. Subsequently, I utilized this game as a learning project to enhance my understanding of SOLID principles and flexible code architecture. From the coding point of view, the UI system is probably the most interesting here. I still use it whenever I need an UI supporting arrow key navigation in my projects.
